	abstract = {This study models how new ideas, practices, or diseases spread within and between communities, the diffusion of innovations or contagion. Several factors affect diffusion such as the characteristics of the initial adopters, the seeds; the structure of the network over which diffusion occurs; and the shape of the threshold distribution, which is the proportion of prior adopting peers needed for the focal individual to adopt. In this study, seven seeding conditions are modeled: (1) three opinion leadership indicators, (2) two bridging measures, (3) marginally positioned seeds, and (4) randomly selected seeds for comparison. Three network structures are modeled: (1) random, (2) small-world, and (3) scale-free. Four threshold distributions are modeled: (1) normal; (2) uniform; (3) beta 7,14; and (4) beta 1,2; all of which have a mean threshold of 33\%, with different variances. The results show that seeding with nodes high on in-degree centrality and/or inverse constraint has faster and more widespread diffusion. Random networks had faster and higher prevalence of diffusion than scale-free ones, but not different from small-world ones. Compared with the normal threshold distribution, the uniform one had faster diffusion and the beta 7,14 distribution had slower diffusion. Most significantly, the threshold distribution standard deviation was associated with rate and prevalence such that higher threshold standard deviations accelerated diffusion and increased prevalence. These results underscore factors that health educators and public health advocates should consider when developing interventions or trying to understand the potential for behavior change.},

            We leveraged exogenous variation in weather patterns across geographies to identify social contagion in exercise behaviours across a global social network. We estimated these contagion effects by combining daily global weather data, which creates exogenous variation in running among friends, with data on the network ties and daily exercise patterns of ∼1.1M individuals who ran over 350M km in a global social network over 5 years. Here we show that exercise is socially contagious and that its contagiousness varies with the relative activity of and gender relationships between friends. Less active runners influence more active runners, but not the reverse. Both men and women influence men, while only women influence other women. While the Embeddedness and Structural Diversity theories of social contagion explain the influence effects we observe, the Complex Contagion theory does not. These results suggest interventions that account for social contagion will spread behaviour change more effectively.},

In contrast to earlier studies, we find evidence of contagion operating over network ties, even after controlling for marketing effort and arbitrary systemwide changes. More importantly, we also find that the amount of contagion is moderated by both the recipients' perception of their opinion leadership and the sources' volume of product usage. The other key finding is that sociometric and self-reported measures of leadership are weakly correlated and associated with different kinds of adoption-related behaviors, which suggests that they probably capture different constructs. We discuss the implications of these novel findings for diffusion theory and research and for marketing practice.},

            Social Networks and Health provides a comprehensive introduction to how social networks influence health behaviors. Section one provides an introduction to major research themes and perspectives used to understand how networks form, evolve, and channel the spread of ideas and behaviors. An intellectual history of the field is provided as well as conjectures on why network science took so long to develop. Methodologies for studying networks and assessing personal network data are discussed. Section two covers algorithms and applications of the most common network metrics divided into four chapters: centrality, groups, positions, and network level. For each chapter, descriptions of how the metrics are calculated and how they influence health behavior are presented. Section three reviews applications of social network analysis to health behaviors. The actor-oriented stochastic evolution model is presented first which provides a way to statistically test network evolution properties. Diffusion of innovations models are presented next which describe how networks influence the spread of ideas and practices within and between communities. Network interventions are also presented and a typology describing network interventions and evidence from empirical studies presented. This book enables researchers to understand how network data are collected and processed; and how to calculate appropriate metrics and models used to understand network influences on health behavior. Simple examples and data are presented throughout so researchers can adopt this methodology and perspective in their own investigations. Examples of health behaviors include smoking, substance use, contraception, HIV/AIDS, obesity, and many others.},

            Behavioral diffusion is commonly modeled with the linear threshold model, which assumes that individuals adopt a behavior when enough of their social contacts do so. We observe, however, that in many common empirical settings individuals also appear to abandon a behavior when too many of their close contacts exhibit it. The bi-threshold model captures this tendency by adding an upper threshold, which, when exceeded, triggers behavioral disadoption. Here we report an empirical test of the bi-threshold model. We overcome the significant challenge of estimating individuals’ heterogeneous thresholds by extending a recently introduced decision-tree based algorithm to the bi-threshold setting. Using the context of the spread of news about three different topics on social media (the Higgs boson, the Melbourne Cup horse race, and the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in China), we show that the bi-threshold model predicts user engagement with the news orders of magnitude more accurately than the linear threshold model. We show that the performance gains are due especially to the bi-threshold model’s comparative advantage in predicting behavioral decline, an important but previously overlooked stage of the behavioral diffusion cycle. Overall, the results confirm the existence of the second upper threshold in some contexts of diffusion of information and suggest that a similar mechanism may operate in other decision-making contexts.},

By the late 1960s, rural sociologists lost interest in diffusion studies, not because it was ineffective scientifically, but because of lack of support for such study as a consequence of farm overproduction and because most of the interesting research questions were thought to be answered.},

	abstract = {This study compared mass media and interpersonal influence during a reproductive health communication campaign in Bolivia using the following six behavior change steps: awareness, detailed knowledge, attitudes, intention, interpersonal communication, and family planning method use. The authors found that the main terms of mass media campaign and personal network exposure were associated with behavior change, whereas the multiplicative interaction term was not. Further analysis showed that the mass media campaign was associated with contraceptive adoption for individuals with personal networks composed of few contraceptive users (as perceived by the respondent) and not for individuals with personal networks containing a majority of users. These findings indicate that the mass media may substitute for personal network influences and speed social change by accelerating the behavior change process.},

  abstract={ There have been many explanations for why countries ratify global environmental treaties. They range from neorealist theory, to hegemony theory, world society theory, and network embeddedness theory. Drawing on hegemonic transition theory, this paper provides evidence that prior to the fall of the Soviet Union, strong and weak countries ratified a treaty if the USA or the USSR ratified the treaty first. After the fall of the Soviet Union, countries’ proximity to world society institutions increased the likelihood of ratifying a treaty, and only weaker countries emulated the ratifications of the USA and Russia. However, weaker countries also emulated economic, religious, and language peers, diplomatic ties, and neighbors as well. In contrast, more powerful countries ratified treaties more independently. We studied the ratifications of eight universal environmental treaties by 166 countries between 1981 and 2008 and showed that as the geopolitical context changed, the diffusion process changed. The paper argues that the hegemonic transition which took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s was an enabling event that helped to explain the new roles that major powers assumed in the 1990s and 2000s and opened the door to the ascendency of global institutions and broader participation in the environmental regime.},
